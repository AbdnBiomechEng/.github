# Welcome

Welcome to the GitHub site for the Aberdeen Biomechanics and Biomedical Engineering group. We are part of the [Electrical and Electronic Systems Research Group](https://www.abdn.ac.uk/engineering/research/power-systems-communications-optics-123.php), although we are a broad mix of staff and students in electrical, biomedical and mechanical engineering, and computer, medical and healthcare science.

We are interested in musculoskeletal biomechanics (in particular of the shoulder and upper limb), the design and optimisation of technologies for functional restoration and rehabilitation, and developing new methods of modelling and measuring human movement.
